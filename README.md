This project was based on two inspirations I had. One from Jen Simmons 
https://www.youtube.com/c/LayoutLand/videos(YouTube: and the other was the design itself, from dribbble. https://dribbble.com/hstretovych

Jen Simmons makes css grid easy to understand. Not alone she makes design on the web interesting to learn. After her lessons I looked for a design on dribbble and found this. 

I spend about three days on the project.

Spent a quiet some time on this css alone. I've been pretty confortable with css grid since then.
```css
.hero {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 10em 18em 4.4996em minmax(3em, 1fr) minmax(14em, 18em) 7em minmax(10em, 15em) 5em;

    grid-template-rows: minmax(8em, 1fr) auto auto 3em minmax(12em, 1fr) 2.4em minmax(6em, 12em);
}
```
